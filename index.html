				<h1>A chance for Alistair Sinclair-Smith to show his quality</h1>
				<p>Hi there!</p>
				<p>I'm <strong>Alistair Sinclair-Smith</strong> and, if you're reading this, I imagine you're trying to get a better idea of what I'm like and what I can do. Well you've come to the right place...</p>
				<p>This page is the product of my efforts to learn <strong>coding</strong>, combined with some of the knowledge I've gained from my years in <strong>SEO</strong>. I also see it as a great opportunity to show you the real me, that's right I'm going to let out my geeky side!</p>
				<p>So keep scrolling and I hope you enjoy learning about me as much as I have learning to code!</p>

				<h2>The secret to investing in a new SEO with less risk and more reward</h2>
				<p>It's time to stop worrying about training a new employee.</p>
				<p>You're about to learn why your next new recruit will develop into <strong>a highly skilled worker</strong>, while your expert staff remain focused on their best work.</p>
				<p>So you can keep generating great money while adding someone who's going to keep improving. Win-win!</p>
				<p>Find out how...</p>

				<h3>Training is draining</h3>
				<p>Hiring experienced staff is a safe bet but an expensive one too. Equally, getting junior staff in and training them is a drain on time and resources.</p>
				<p>Wouldn't it be great to have someone learning and helping out while your best staff can still focus on making you <strong>lots of cash</strong>?</p>
				<p>That's where I'm of value...</p>
				<p>I learn through a combination of reading and performing tasks. There's less requirement for formal training, just let me research and give me things to do as I'm desperate to get cracking!</p>
				<p>But what if I get stuck?</p>
				<p>I also love problem solving. So when something doesn't work, I'm busy finding a way to fix it. Sometimes I'll find I need to ask questions of colleagues but that's when I know it'll be a time-saver.</p>
				<p>So I'm largely autonomous, leaving more time for your people to keep bringing you wins!</p>
				<p>And there's more.</p>
				<p>I'm not like a lot of junior level staff. I've a few years working in SEO already, just with limited responsibility.</p>
				<p>I already have some solid <a href="#KST">skills and experience</a> under my belt. Why waste your time getting someone to grasp a lot of on-page basics when I'm already familiar with them?</p>
				<p>Sounds like I could be of <strong>value</strong>.</p>
				<p>So stop gambling and stop spending loads on recruitment and training. Don't get it wrong and haemorrhage employees until you get a good fit.</p>
				<p>Brilliant people like me are out there, looking to develop ourselves while making you <strong>more money</strong>.</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>

			<div class="box h">
				<h3>What I do</h3>
				<p>I'm a 2011 Marketing graduate who's since tried his hand in various fields; from customer service to data admin.</p>
				<p>Working with websites is something I've taken the most enjoyment from and that lead to working in SEO in recent years.</p>
				<p>My SEO experience has been with the on-page side but I'm really excited about exploring off-page techniques in the future.</p>
				<p>I'm currently out of work but using the time productively by volunteering on a non-profit site, learning lots and improving this page.</p>

				<h3>So what have I been learning?</h3>
				<p>Of course I'm continuing to improve my current knowledge of SEO, HTML and CSS.</p>
				<p>Here's a little more about an important part of that...</p>
				<p>I'm going through the <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/">Google Analytics Academy</a> courses to learn more about those tools.</p>
				<p>It's an essential part of SEO that I've been disappointed not to use much so far. Rather than wait for the chance to explore it further in my next job, I'm working on it now. That way I'll be up to speed when it's needed.</p>
				<p>I'm also working towards a better understanding of the following things:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>JavaScript</li>
					<li>UI</li>
					<li>Aesthetic Web Design</li>
				</ul>
				<p>But I won't stop there.</p>
				<p>I want to learn more about improving accessibility and page speed. Both of these can impact SEO but also hold importance individually.</p>
				<p>I've read a little about them before but feel I'm still a way off knowing enough.</p>

				<h2>Special Thanks</h2>
				<p>I owe a hell of a lot of gratitude to my old friend Matt Thomas.</p>
				<p>He's a brilliant web developer, problem solver, and even trying his hand at writing a novel (is there anything he can't do?).</p>
				<p>Even better than that, he's an excellent human being that I'm lucky to know.</p>
				<p>It was Matt who got me into learning to code and he's helped me immeasurably along the way.</p>
				<p>From answering my questions to fixing up a MacBook so I could get started, this page wouldn't be possible without all his help.</p>
				<p>Go check out his beautiful <a href="https://insidae.com/">insidae website</a> now!</p>
