				<h1>Introducing: Alistair Sinclair-Smith</h1>
				<p>Hi there!</p>
				<p>I'm <strong>Alistair Sinclair-Smith</strong> and, if you're reading this, I imagine you're trying to get a better idea of what I'm like and what I can do.</p>
				<p>Well you've come to the right place...</p>
				<p>This page is the product of my efforts to learn <strong>coding</strong>, combined with some of the knowledge I've gained from my years in <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation"><strong>SEO</strong></abbr>.</p>
				<p>So keep scrolling and find out more. I hope you enjoy learning about me as much as I have learning to code!</p>

				</div>
				<div class="postheading">
					<p>It's time to stop worrying about training someone new.</p>
					<p>You're about to learn why your next recruit will progress to being a skillful employee, while your experts stay focused on their best work.</p>
					<p>So you can keep generating lots of money, while adding someone who continues improving and helps you make more. Win-win!</p>
					<p>Find out how...</p>
					<img src="assets/images/google_search_screenshot.png" alt="A Google search for 'finding the right employee'." id="screenshot1">
					<h3>Training is draining</h3>
					<p>Hiring experienced staff is a safe but expensive bet. Equally, getting junior staff in and training them is a drain on time and resources.</p>
					<p>Wouldn't it be great to have someone learning and helping out while your best staff can still focus on making you <strong>lots of cash</strong>?</p>
					<p>That's where I'm of value...</p>
					<p>I learn through a combination of reading and performing tasks. There's less requirement for formal training, just let me research and give me things to do as I'm desperate to get cracking!</p>
					<p>But what if I get stuck?</p>
					<p>I also love <strong>problem solving</strong>. So when something doesn't work, I'm busy finding a way to fix it. Sometimes I'll find I need to ask questions of colleagues but that's when I know it'll be a time-saver.</p>
					<p>So I'm largely autonomous and if I'm finding solutions myself, it leaves more time for your people to keep bringing you wins!</p>
					<p>And there's more.</p>
					<p>I'm different from a lot of junior level staff. I've some solid <a href="#KST" class="content-link">skills and experience</a> from previous SEO roles with limited responsibility.</p>
					<p>Why waste your time getting someone to grasp a lot of on-page basics when I'm already familiar with them?</p>
					<p>Sounds like I could be of <strong>value</strong>.</p>
					<p>So stop gambling while spending loads on recruitment and training. Don't get it wrong and haemorrhage employees finding a good fit.</p>
					<p>Brilliant people like me, Alistair Sinclair-Smith, are out there, looking to develop ourselves while making you <strong>more money</strong>.</p>

					<h2>About Me</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="postheading">
					<h3>What I do</h3>
					<p>I'm a 2011 Marketing graduate who's since tried his hand in various fields; from customer service to data admin.</p>
					<p>Working with websites is something I've taken the most enjoyment from and that lead to working in SEO in recent years.</p>
					<p>My SEO experience has been with the on-page side but I'm really excited about exploring off-page techniques in the future.</p>
					<p>I'm currently out of work but using the time productively by volunteering on a non-profit site, learning and improving this page.</p>

					<h3>So what have I been learning?</h3>
					<p>I'm actively improving my current knowledge of SEO, <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> & <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
					<p>Here's a little more about an important part of that...</p>
					<p>I'm going through the <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/" target="_blank" class="content-link">Google Analytics Academy</a> courses to learn more about those tools. It's an essential part of SEO that I've been disappointed not to use much so far. Rather than waiting to explore it further in my next job, I'm working on it now. That way I'll be up to speed when it's needed.</p>
					<img src="assets/images/GAA_Beginners_Certificate.png" alt="Alistair Sinclair-Smith's certificate from completing the Google Analytics Academy Beginners Course." id="certificate">
					<p>As you can see, I've recently completed the beginners course. Next I'll get working on the advanced one!</p>
					<p>I'm also working towards a better understanding of the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>JavaScript</li>
						<li><abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> Design</li>
						<li>Aesthetic Web Design</li>
					</ul>
					<p>But I won't stop there.</p>
					<p>I want to learn more about improving accessibility and page speed. Both of these can impact SEO but also hold importance individually.</p>
