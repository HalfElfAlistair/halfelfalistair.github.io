## Introduction

My first repo, also a GitHub pages website. It's a page that should give you a better idea of who I am and what I've done. It was originally built as a static HTML & CSS page, back in 2019/2020. Having since learned and worked in React for a few years, I felt it would be right to convert it to that in 2025.


### Aims

* Suitably display a snapshot of my work, with relevant GitHub repo links.
* Demonstrate what I have to offer for potential employers.
* Have a space where I can experiment and show some of the things I've learned.


## Technologies

## Acknowledgments

### Matt Thomas
It was Matt who introduced me to coding and has been an incredible help throughout my journey. He's an excellent friend and a brilliant developer. Go check out his [insidae website](https://insidae.com/).

### [Northcoders](https://www.northcoders.com/)
While I learned the basics from Matt, plus CodeAcademy and FreeCodeCamp (mentioned below), I eventually embarked on a course at Northcoders to further advance my knowledge and help me on my career path. Looking back on where I am now and what I knew (or rather didn't) before starting with them, it's clear they've been an essential part of my development.

### [The Philadelphia Eagles](https://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/)
After trying out various colour schemes for this page I was still struggling to find one I was happy with. While watching the NFL show one night, it dawned on me that the dark green used by the Eagles was what I needed. Interestingly the colour (Midnight green) is additionally known as Eagle green because of the team. I might try using sports jerseys as design inspiration in future.

### [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
CodeAcademy was the first site I used to learn HTML and CSS and has taught me some of the skills I've used to create this page.

### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
The educational and practical opportunity to develop my coding skills.

### [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/)
Matt suggested I check out an article written by Tania to help with my design decisions and it was a great call. This page looks a lot better now than it did before I read their work!

### [WebAIM.org](https://webaim.org/)
Their colour contrast checker is a go to for me every time so I can ensure my work is readable.
