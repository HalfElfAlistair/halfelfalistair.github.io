## Acknowledgments

### [Matt Thomas](https://insidae.com/)
It was Matt who introduced me to coding and has been an incredible help throughout my journey. Matt also took the picture I use in my header (the guy is super multi talented). He's an excellent friend and a brilliant developer. Go check out his insidae website.

### The Philadelphia Eagles
After trying out various colour schemes for this page I was still struggling to find one I was happy with. While watching the NFL show one night, it dawned on me that the dark green used by the Eagles was what I needed. Interestingly the colour (Midnight green) is additionally known as Eagle green because of the team. I might try using sports jerseys as design inspiration in future.

### [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
CodeAcademy was the first site I used to learn HTML and CSS and has taught me some of the skills I've used to create this page.

### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
The educational and practical opportunity to develop my coding skills.

### [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/)
Matt suggested I check out an article written by Tania to help with my design decisions and it was a great call. This page looks a lot better now than it did before I read their work!

### [WS3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
Their 'how to' guide for creating a responsive hamburger menu was really useful in helping me create one for my page but also helped improve my understanding of JavaScript.

### [WebAIM.org](https://webaim.org/)
Their colour contrast checker is a go to for me every time so I can ensure my work is readable.

### [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
I acquired my social icons from here.
